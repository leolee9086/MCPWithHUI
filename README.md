# MCPWithHUI Project

This project implements the concept of **Model Context Protocol with Human User Interface (MCPWithHUI)**.

## Core Concept

The goal is to create a system where:

1.  **MCP Server With HUI**: An MCP Server whose defined `Resources` and `Tools` are designed not only for programmatic consumption (by LLMs/Agents) but also contain rich metadata suitable for dynamically rendering a **Human User Interface (HUI)**.
2.  **MCP Client With HUI**: An MCP Client application that connects to an MCP Server With HUI, retrieves the available Resources and Tools, and **dynamically renders an interactive UI** based on the metadata provided by the server. Users interact with this HUI to invoke the server's capabilities.

Essentially, the user, interacting through the HUI generated by the Client, acts as another "agent" capable of utilizing the capabilities defined by the MCP Server.

## Project Structure (Initial)

*   `server/`: Contains the implementation of the MCP Server With HUI.
*   `client/`: Contains the implementation of the MCP Client With HUI (e.g., a web-based UI).
*   `shared/`: Contains shared code, such as TypeScript types, utilized by both the server and client.
